# Snapshots Peek for Xcode

### An Xcode Plugin to give you a preview of the class you're looking at when using FBSnapshots

#### Main Features

* Shows your snapshots along the bottom of your editor.
* Peeks fades away once you start scrolling.
* Lots of effort put into making sure as much work as possible is done off the main thread.

#### Upcoming Ideas

* Would be great to see a dock-like resize as your mouse gets closer to the images.

#### Installation

Install via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/). In Xcode choose Window, Package Manager and search for "SnapshotsPeek".

#### Contributing

It's actually [_way_ easier](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/) to work on Plugins than you think. Hitting run in Xcode on this project will open a new Xcode with a working lldb instance and you can work on it like any other app.
